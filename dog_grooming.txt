<h2>A Groomed Pet is a Healthy Pet</h2>
<p>Adopt &amp; Shop Untangled provides high-quality grooming services for the beauty and health of your pets. The salon offers full service styling as well as bath and brush services. In addition, a menu of Paw La Carte services ranging from teeth brushing to nail trimming are also available. The key benefits of grooming are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your pet will look good and feel comfortable</li>
<li>Your groomer becomes familiar with your pet&rsquo;s health and can spot problems early</li>
<li>Regular grooming can prevent matting, reduce excessive oils from the coat and nurture the skin</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Grooming Service Pricing</h2>
<p>At Adopt &amp; Shop Untangled, our professional stylists will personally meet with you to discuss your pet&rsquo;s specific needs and recommend the proper dog grooming service. Due to differences in breeds, varying conditions of the coat, size of the dog, and time needed to complete the service, grooming prices are determined after your dog is assessed at check in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Special Adoption Package</h2>
<p>Receive 25% off your first package from Adopt & Shop Untangled when you show that your dog was adopted from Adopt & Shop, or any local shelter or rescue group. Speak with an Adopt & Shop Untangled associate for more details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Grooming Services</h2>
<h3>Bubbles &amp; Brush</h3>
<p>The perfect service for dogs that do not require a full styling appointment. The groomer will brush your dog, removing superficial tangles or mats, give them a bath, and condition their coat.

<li>15 minutes of brushing</li>
<li>Oxygen-infused bath</li>
<li>Shampoo and conditioners</li>
<li>Blow dry</li>
<li>Nail trim</li>
<li>Ear cleaning</li>
<li>Anal gland expression</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Signature Styling</h3>
<p>Our trained stylists will shape and cut your dog&rsquo;s coat to the most popular breed types or customize a style that you like.</p>
<p>Every Signature Styling includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scissor cut and clipper sculpting</li>
<li>Shaving pads and sanitary trim</li>
<li>Oxygen-infused bath</li>
<li>Blow dry</li>
<li>Shampoo and conditioners</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Teeth Brushing </h3>
<p>A good brushing will improve dental care and brighten their smile!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Special Shampoos &amp; Conditioners</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A variety of de-shedding techniques used to remove a dog&rsquo;s undercoat. Perfect prior to bathing suit season!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Walk-in Services</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nails</h3>
