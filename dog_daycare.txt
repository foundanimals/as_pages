<h1>Full Service Dog Daycare in Culver City</h1>
<h2>How to Book an Appointment</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Adopt & Shop Playtime is Fun!</h2>
<p>Adopt &amp; Shop Playtime is a fun way to give dogs exercise, mental stimulation and socialize with both dogs and people. This is a great way to prevent separation anxiety and keep your pet active, especially new pets that haven&rsquo;t settled into a routine with their family. Dog daycare consists of daily activities, games, nap time and group play. Pets are kept in separate play areas based on size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dog Daycare at Adopt & Shop</h2>
<p>Dog daycare at Adopt & Shop Playtime consists of a balance of play and quiet time to rest. This is done to ensure that individual dogs get lots of stimulation but have diversity throughout the day.</p>
<p>Dog Daycare is a superior alternative to dog sitting because the pet interacts with other dogs. Before entering the program each dog must be assessed on our &ldquo;10 Points of Play&rdquo; compatibility profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Daycare Pricing</h2>
<p>At Adopt &amp; Shop Playtime, our caring staff will personally recommend the right daycare service for your pet. With packages ranging from &frac12; day to 20 sessions, your pet could have loads of fun for as little as $32 a day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dog Daycare Activities</h2>
<p>Adopt &amp; Shop Playtime offers dogs a balance of mentally stimulating activities and tranquil relaxation. Each day, your dog may go through a number of activities like Tug Time with Toys, naps and snacks, play ball, quiet time, and interactive games. We alternate between excitement and down-time to maintain routines and energy levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vaccinations &amp; Health Requirements</h2>
<p>For the health and safety of our guests, all dogs must show proof of vaccination for Rabies, DHLPP, and Bordatella, before a pet is admitted into Adopt &amp; Shop Playtime. Vaccinations must be administered at least 48 hours prior to arrival under the guidance of a licensed veterinarian.</p>
<p>All dogs must be over 4 months of age and be spayed or neutered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to Schedule a Compatibility Assessment</h2>
<p>Safety is our number one priority for animals, customers and staff. We require that each dog must be assessed on our &ldquo;10 Points of Play&rdquo; compatibility profile. The assessment is free, but requires an appointment and drop off for the day. Our goal is to make sure your dog will play well with other visitors to Adopt &amp; Shop Playtime.</p>
