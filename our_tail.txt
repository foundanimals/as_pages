<p class="large">Found Animals’ Adopt & Shop was launched in support of a single belief: all pets deserve a home. We are a community of humane adoption and retail centers, staffed by passionate volunteers and store associates who help make sure every pet has a  safe haven.</p>

<p class="large">Adopt & Shop Culver City is truly a one-stop adoption and shopping experience.  We are the only nonprofit pet retailer in California that offers pet adoption, daycare, grooming, dog training, and a complete line of quality and unique products to support  happy and healthy pets.</p>

<p class="large">But we can’t do it alone.  We need volunteers to assist in caring for the animals.  Our volunteers are given the opportunity to make a positive impact on their community, one animal at a time.</p>

<p class="large">While others do great work to support animals, no one offers total care for your dog or cat like Adopt & Shop in Culver City.</p>

<p class="large">Since our adoptable dogs and cats come from local shelters, every adoption saves the life of an at-risk animal.  Our experienced store associates are here to support families in creating happy and healthy homes for their pets.</p>

<p class="large">As a part of the Found Animals nonprofit organization, we’re empowered to approach adoptions differently. Proceeds from Adopt & Shop retail sales are donated to programs that support the happiness and safety of animals in our homes, shelters and everywhere in between.</p>
